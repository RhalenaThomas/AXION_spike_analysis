# Raw spike_list.csv files exported from AXION Biosystems MEA recording.

Includes all data including outliers across all batches analyzed. 

For the Pharmacology data, all wells listed in files under the Quinpirole Treatment folder are matched to the same well in the raw data from "5Month_Data" folder. For example, recording data taken from well C1 in IsoCTL_Batch2_spike_list_Quinpirole.csv is compared to recording data taken from well C1 in IsoCTL_Batch2_spike_list.csv. This is the same organoid before and after Quinpirole treatment. 

For the Tetrabenazine Treatment data, both organoids untreated and chronically treated with tetrabenzaine are on the same MEA plate. Wells D1-D6 are untreated organoids while wells B1-B6 are tetrabenazine treated organoids. The data found in IsoCTL_Tetrabenazine_and_Quinpirole_Treated.csv are the same organoids that were chronically treated with tetrabenazine but were subsequently treated with quinpirole.
